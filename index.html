<h2>About</h2>
<p>Each PC is built on an individual workstation ( No Production Line Here !! ) by one technician from beginning to end . Every stage is overseen
by the same technician who is both an enthusiast and a qualified technical services engineer. This means that the Custom Built PC is the
reasponsibility of one person and not a drone on a production line who does not know anything about the finished product . Our technicians are
not only highly skilled at their jobs they are also enthusiasts which means our systems are built by enthusiasts for enthusiasts . 

Every PC goes through Multiple Stages Including a 72 Hour Burn in & Performance Evalution Period  with PassMark prior to final shipment.
We do everything in our power to avoid any issues when you receive your New Custom PC and therefore all PCs must pass this multi point testing procedure.

"You Imagine , We Build & Design" which is another saying of our principal founders which also carries on the traditions of Alienware™
pre Dell™ assimilation. We offer 1000's of individual options and upgrades across our entire ranges of custom desktop and laptop PCs
from memory , CPU , HDD , SDDs to Cases and Power Supplies. 

All of our Systems come Pre Assembled and when you choose and operating system the PC will be Installed with all the latest drivers &
AntiVirus Software. This means when you receive the PC all you have to do is take it our of the box and plug it in .
There is no bloatware on oue PCs as we firmly believe this software hinders the performance of the PC. 

Another Ideal is that we offer the latest models and versions of components and software and we can do this because our systems
are not built on a production line where a small change to a specification can take months . If you need to make any
upgrades which are not listed on the drop down menus of our configurators please email sales@torquegaming.ie or sales@custompc.ie and we will do our best to assist. 

Every component is carefully chosen by our experienced technicians and we use on only the best and most reliable components from the leading manufacturers.
